Bird audio recognition, particularly identifying specific species based on their vocalizations, holds significant potential in various fields. From environmental studies to wildlife monitoring and even conservation efforts, accurate identification of bird species can provide critical insights into biodiversity, population trends, and behaviour patterns. However, traditional methods of bird identification often rely heavily on field guides and human observers, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors. This study introduces a novel model designed to identify the Capuchin bird voice among others using machine learning techniques. The model leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze spectrograms.
This model listenes to the audio and process it to tell the number of times it heard the bird audio and store them in a CSV file.
