Bird audio recognition, particularly identifying specific species based on their vocalizations, holds significant potential in various fields. From environmental studies to wildlife monitoring and even conservation efforts, accurate identification of bird species can provide critical insights into biodiversity, population trends, and behaviour patterns. However, traditional methods of bird identification often rely heavily on field guides and human observers, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors. This study introduces a novel model designed to identify the Capuchin bird voice among others using machine learning techniques. The model leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze spectrograms. This approach allows to make the process of identification of bird voices much faster and more accurate. The modelâ€™s ability to count birds chirping can contribute significantly to our understanding of avian biodiversity and behaviour. It can aid in the early detection of rare or endangered species, monitor changes in bird populations over time, and even inform strategies for habitat conservation. Furthermore, this technology could also be integrated into smartphone apps or IoT devices, enabling everyday citizens to contribute to bird surveillance and conservation efforts. While this study focuses on the Capuchin bird voice, the model's architecture and training process could be adapted to recognize other bird species as well, expanding its utility and applicability. In conclusion, the development of this bird audio recognition model represents a significant step forward in harnessing the power of machine learning for environmental research and conservation.
